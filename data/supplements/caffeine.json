      "question": "What is caffeine?",
      "answer": "Caffeine is a psychoactive drug that exerts a powerful stimulant effect on the central nervous system. It is naturally found in coffee , tea , and chocolate , but is also added to some soft drinks (e.g. colas), energy drinks and energy shots. [8] The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that roughly 89% of adults in the US consume caffeine daily. [12] People often use caffeine-containing beverages to help restore alertness and wakefulness or to reduce drowsiness when feeling mentally fatigued . [13] [14] Caffeine is also available as a purified powder, and it is found in some dietary supplements claiming to cause weight loss or increase energy (e.g. pre-workouts). [8] [15] [16] Additionally, caffeine is found in some over-the-counter drugs used to relieve pain [17] [18] and in prescription drugs used to treat breathing problems in premature babies. [19] After ingestion, caffeine acts rapidly on the central nervous system, triggering several short-lived effects including an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and urine output. [20] [21] [22] [23] However, with regular daily use, these symptoms of caffeine typically become less pronounced. [20] [22] [8] [13] [14]"

      "question": "What are caffeine’s main benefits?",
      "answer": "Caffeine restores alertness and wakefulness , and reduces drowsiness during mental fatigue. [24] [25] [26] It also improves several aspects of cognitive function — accuracy, reasoning, memory , reaction time , attention , etc. — during cognitively and/or physically demanding tasks. [27] [24] [25] [26] Furthermore, caffeine can improve some aspects of cognitive function that have been impaired by acute sleep deprivation. [25] [26] Caffeine can also help with pain relief . For example, when caffeine is added to analgesic (pain relieving) drugs like acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol ) or ibuprofen , there is a small but clinically meaningful improvement in pain . [17] [18] In hospitals, caffeine (typically caffeine citrate) is used to treat apnea (temporary cessation of breathing) in premature babies, but both the optimal dosing strategy and caffeine’s effect on survival and subsequent neurocognitive development are unclear. [19] Furthermore, in people with asthma , caffeine may have a small beneficial effect on some aspects of respiratory function (forced expiratory volume in one second, FEV1, and mid-expiratory flow rate) for up to four hours. [28] However, this effect also has implications for asthma diagnostics because prior caffeine ingestion may reduce the accuracy of lung function tests. [28] Caffeine can raise whole-body fat oxidation rates, both at rest and during exercise, [29] [30] and increase daily energy expenditure, [31] [32] but these effects are negligible — approximately 400 kilojoules or 100 kilocalories per day. The effect of caffeine on appetite regulation and energy intake is less clear and varies depending on factors like timing and dose. [32] [33] Consequently, the role of caffeine in weight loss and/or weight management is unclear. Despite one meta-analysis concluding that caffeine can promote reductions in weight , BMI , and body fat , [34] its utility is limited because the included trials used energy-restriction diets and/or ephedrine , a powerful stimulant that causes weight loss. Caffeine is widely used in sports because it can improve both aerobic and anaerobic performance in trained and untrained individuals. [1] For example, when taken before or during exercise, caffeine has small to moderate-sized effects of lowering the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) [35] [36] and improving aerobic endurance, anaerobic power, sprint speed, muscle endurance, muscle strength, muscle power (jump height), and agility. [1] [37] [38] These effects are found across a range of sports (running, cycling, and swimming, etc.) including skill-based team sports (e.g. basketball, soccer, etc.). [1] [39] [40] Furthermore, when taken before and/or during exercise, caffeine may also improve cognitive functions, such as attention , reaction time , memory , and feelings of fatigue . [24] One drawback is the predominance of research studies that only included young male participants. [37] [1] Some meta-analyses find similar performance benefits in females to those found in males, [41] [42] [43] but more randomized controlled trials in females are needed to substantiate the generalization of sports nutrition recommendations for caffeine. [1] [44]"

      "question": "What are caffeine’s main drawbacks?",
      "answer": "Caffeine is generally safe for most people if used within the recommended amounts (up to 400 mg per day in a healthy adult, or up to 200 mg in a single dose — see the dosage information section. [3] Furthermore, caffeine-containing beverages like tea and coffee are socially acceptable and widely used. [45] [12] However, caffeine has several side effects and drawbacks. The side effects of caffeine include a short-lived rise in heart rate and blood pressure, heart palpitations, headache, increased urine output, nervousness, gastrointestinal problems, etc. [20] [21] [22] [23] Caffeine can also raise heart rate during and following exercise. [46] [2] Some of these side effects, particularly those related to heart rate, blood pressure, and urine output, may subside with regular use due to increased tolerance. [20] [22] [8] [13] [14] Because caffeine can cause mild drug dependence , some people also experience withdrawal symptoms — headache, drowsiness , and irritability — when they stop using caffeine after regular daily intake. [47] One of the major drawbacks is that caffeine impairs sleep quality and can reduce sleep duration . [48] [49] A recent meta-analysis found that to prevent deleterious effects on subsequent sleep, coffee should be consumed at least 9 hours before bedtime, and a caffeine-containing pre-workout supplement should be consumed at least 13 hours before bedtime. [48] Sadly, there have been several case reports of caffeine toxicity [50] [51] [52] [53] and caffeine-related death. [54] [55] [56] [57] However, considering the high global prevalence of caffeine intake, these cases are rare. [45] [12] [58] Such cases also typically involve exceptionally high caffeine intakes (usually unintentional but sometimes purposeful) or caffeine intake combined with other drugs and alcohol. [54] Some instances of toxicity and death involve energy drinks — beverages that contain as much as 300 mg of caffeine plus other stimulants like taurine , in addition to B vitamins and sugar . [59] At the population level, energy drinks are unlikely to cause harm because there is a low prevalence of consumption. [60] [61] However, in certain groups (children, teenagers, people with underlying heart conditions), health risks can emerge when people far exceed recommended daily caffeine intake limits by consuming energy drinks with other caffeine-containing foods and beverages. [60] [61] Some epidemiological studies have found a relationship between high daily caffeine intake (e.g. more than 4 to 6 cups of coffee per day) and increased cardiovascular disease risk. [62] [63] [64] [65] However, the evidence from mendelian randomization studies and meta-analyses of epidemiological studies shows that caffeine (or coffee) intake does not increase the risk of cardiovascular disease , including coronary artery disease , stroke , heart failure , and cardiovascular disease mortality , [61] [65] [66] [67] and that moderate intake might even be protective. [68] [69] [70] [71] Some studies also find a relationship between caffeine intake during pregnancy and poorer health outcomes for mother and baby following birth; however, the entirety of the evidence is equivocal. [72] [73] Furthermore, it is unclear whether reducing caffeine intake during pregnancy has any effect on pregnancy outcomes, including infant health and birth weight . [72] [73] However, some authorities recommend that pregnant women limit their caffeine intake to 200 milligrams per day (the equivalent of 1–2 cups of coffee per day or less). [5]"

      "question": "How does caffeine work?",
      "answer": "Caffeine’s mechanisms of action are not completely understood, but the proposed mechanisms likely act in unison. [14] [1] [74] Caffeine’s primary action is in the central nervous system, where it prevents adenosine from binding to its receptor. [75] [14] [74] This affects the secretion of several neurotransmitters — norepinephrine , dopamine , acetylcholine, serotonin, GABA , etc. — involved in alertness , mood , motivation , memory , and pain perception. [14] [76] For example, adenosine released during exercise decreases the secretion of dopamine , a neurotransmitter that increases mood and motivation . [1] [77] So, when taken before or during exercise, caffeine allows dopamine secretion to continue, potentially maintaining mood and motivation to work hard. [77] This, coupled with lower pain perception caused by the lack of adenosine signaling, may partly explain caffeine’s sports-performance-enhancing effects. Caffeine also plays a role in cellular calcium transport, which regulates neurotransmitter secretion in neurons and contractile force in muscle cells. [14] [74] Caffeine can have a direct effect on calcium transport in muscle cells and may, therefore, have a direct effect on muscle contractile force, [1] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] providing an additional explanation for its performance-enhancing effects. Caffeine can also inhibit a group of enzymes called cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs), preventing the breakdown of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). [14] [74] This is important because cAMP stimulates the release of neurotransmitters like dopamine , epinephrine , and norepinephrine , which regulate aspects of cognitive function, including alertness , mood , motivation , and memory . [14] [74] However, this mechanism requires more research and may only occur in the presence of high concentrations of caffeine, i.e., following high caffeine doses."

  "dosage": "⚠️ Attention : La caféine présente des contre-indications et des interactions médicamenteuses Pour la performance sportive La dose optimale pour obtenir des bénéfices sur la performance sportive est de 3 à 6 mg par kilogramme de poids corporel (environ 200 à 400 mg chez une personne de 70 kg), prise environ 60 minutes avant l’exercice. [1] Utiliser une dose au bas de cet intervalle, soit environ 3 mg/kg de caféine avant l’exercice (environ 200 mg chez une personne de 70 kg), procure les bénéfices avec le risque le plus faible d’effets indésirables. [2] Sécurité chez les adultes La caféine est généralement sûre pour la plupart des personnes lorsqu’elle est utilisée dans les quantités recommandées. [3] [4] La Food and Drug Administration des États-Unis (FDA) et l’Autorité européenne de sécurité des aliments (EFSA) indiquent qu’une consommation quotidienne totale de caféine allant jusqu’à 400 milligrammes (mg) ne soulève pas de problème de sécurité chez les adultes non-enceints. [5] [6] L’EFSA précise qu’une consommation quotidienne totale de caféine allant jusqu’à 200 mg chez les femmes enceintes et allaitantes n’augmente pas les risques pour le fœtus ou le nourrisson allaité, et qu’une dose unique de caféine jusqu’à 200 mg (environ 3 mg/kg de poids corporel pour un adulte de 70 kg) ne pose pas de problème de sécurité. [5] En d’autres termes, l’ingestion de caféine est peu susceptible de provoquer des effets néfastes pour la santé si l’apport quotidien est inférieur à 400 mg/j chez les adultes non-enceints, ou inférieur à 200 mg/j chez les femmes enceintes ou allaitantes, et si une dose unique est inférieure à 200 mg. Sécurité chez les enfants et les adolescents Chez les enfants et les adolescents, davantage de recherches sont nécessaires pour préciser la sécurité, les risques pour la santé et les limites supérieures tolérables d’apport. [5] Les données d’une revue systématique suggèrent que les enfants et les adolescents ne devraient pas consommer plus de 2,5 mg/kg de poids corporel par jour (équivalent à 100 mg pour une personne de 40 kg). [3] Cependant, certaines organisations découragent toute consommation de caféine et d’autres stimulants chez les enfants et les adolescents. [6] Caféine dans les aliments et les boissons Les concentrations de caféine dans divers aliments - café, thé, boissons gazeuses (cola), chocolat, boissons énergisantes, etc. - sont très variables. [5] Par exemple, une tasse de café peut contenir environ 50 à 200 mg de caféine, mais la quantité par tasse varie fortement selon le type de grain, le degré de torréfaction et la méthode de préparation. [7] [8] Certaines boissons énergisantes contiennent des quantités très élevées de caféine, et la FDA recommande d’éviter les compléments alimentaires contenant de la caféine pure ou fortement concentrée, car une cuillère à café de caféine en poudre pure contient environ 5 grammes (5000 milligrammes), bien au-delà de la limite supérieure recommandée d’apport quotidien et proche de la dose toxique. [9] Pour un aperçu détaillé du dosage de la caféine, consultez notre article « How Much Caffeine Is Too Much? ». Caféine dans le citrate de caféine Notez que le citrate de caféine contient environ 50 % de caféine en poids, c’est-à-dire qu’une dose de 50 mg de citrate de caféine fournit approximativement 25 mg de caféine.

      "question": "Les différents génotypes influencent-ils l'effet de la caféine ?",
      "answer": "Différents génotypes, en particulier les variantes des gènes CYP1A2 et ADORA2A, peuvent influencer la façon dont les individus métabolisent la caféine et leur sensibilité à ses effets, ce qui impacte des facteurs tels que la consommation habituelle, la fonction cognitive, l'anxiété et les troubles du sommeil. Cependant, les données actuelles suggèrent que ces génotypes n'affectent pas l'influence de la caféine sur le risque de maladie cardiovasculaire."
    },
    {
      "question": "L'utilisation régulière de caféine réduit-elle le bénéfice de la caféine sur la performance à l'exercice ?",
      "answer": "L'utilisation régulière de caféine peut réduire ses effets d'amélioration de la performance lors de l'exercice ; certaines études suggèrent que les utilisateurs habituels ressentent un bénéfice moindre que les non-habitués. Cependant, toutes les recherches ne confirment pas cet effet de tolérance, et une méta-analyse indique que la caféine peut encore améliorer la performance chez les utilisateurs habituels, ce qui suggère que les athlètes devraient expérimenter les doses et le moment de prise pour obtenir des résultats optimaux."
    },
    {
      "question": "L'utilisation régulière de caféine réduit-elle le risque de troubles cognitifs tels que la démence et la maladie d'Alzheimer ?",
      "answer": "Les études épidémiologiques montrent des résultats mitigés concernant la relation entre la consommation à long terme de caféine et le risque de troubles cognitifs ; certaines indiquent un risque moindre, tandis que d'autres ne montrent aucune relation ou un effet inverse. En raison des limites de ces études, des recherches plus rigoureuses sont nécessaires pour tirer des conclusions définitives."
    },
    {
      "question": "La caféine est-elle une substance interdite pour les athlètes ?",
      "answer": "La caféine n'est actuellement pas interdite pour les athlètes et ne figure pas sur la liste des substances prohibées de l'Agence mondiale antidopage, mais elle est surveillée pour un éventuel usage abusif. Les athlètes doivent se tenir informés des mises à jour annuelles de la liste des substances prohibées et des règles spécifiques de l'organisme directeur de leur sport."
    },
    {
      "question": "Le café a-t-il le même effet que la caféine isolée sur la performance à l'exercice ?",
      "answer": "Le café contient divers nutriments ainsi que de la caféine, et bien que certaines études suggèrent qu’il puisse améliorer la performance à l’exercice, la teneur en caféine du café peut varier de façon significative. Pour une performance optimale, il peut être préférable d’utiliser un produit de nutrition sportive avec une dose de caféine connue plutôt que de se fier à une tasse de café moyenne."
